# TourGid Project Development Summary

## Project Context
TourGid is a React Native tourism app for the nFactorial AI Cup 2025 hackathon, featuring an AI agent using Prompt Chaining architecture for voice-guided route planning in Kazakhstan. The user provided Railway URL: `tourgid-production-8074.up.railway.app` and wanted to remove all mock AI services to use only real backend integration.

## Session Progress

### PROMPT 1/10: Backend Integration & Mock Removal
**Completed:**
- Updated `src/services/AIService.js` to use real Railway backend URL
- Removed all LiveKit and FetchAI mock services 
- Simplified architecture to only use real backend API calls
- Added detailed logging for diagnostics
- Kept voice input simulation for Expo Go compatibility

### PROMPT 2/10: Error Diagnosis & Fixes
**Major Issues Identified:**

#### Backend Problems (Railway):
- Error 502 "Application failed to respond" 
- Error 499 (Client Closed Request)
- Railway logs showing SIGTERM and `npm error command failed` with `sh -c node server.js`
- Backend process crashing on startup

#### Frontend Bundling Errors:
- `Unable to resolve "../assets/astana/baiterek.jpg"` from data.js
- `Unable to resolve "./adaptive-icon.png"` from placeholder.js  
- `Unable to resolve "../assets/placeholder.js"` from HistoricalFactsScreen.js
- `Unable to resolve "../assets/historical-facts/pavlodar-foundation.jpg"`

**Actions Taken:**

#### Backend Improvements:
- Added `/favicon.ico` endpoint to prevent 502 errors
- Simplified CORS configuration
- Added `/health` endpoint with detailed system info
- Added request logging middleware
- Removed unused body-parser dependency
- Updated package.json dependencies

#### Data Structure Updates:
- Limited scope to only Astana (4 attractions) and Pavlodar (7 attractions)
- Updated `src/constants/data.js` with correct image paths:
  - Astana: baiterek.jpg, khan-shatyr.jpg, nur-astana-mosque.jpg, national-museum-astana.jpg
  - Pavlodar: mashkhur-zhusup-mosque.jpg, blagoveshchensky-cathedral.jpg, irtysh-embankment.jpg, vasiliev-house-museum.jpg, pavlodar-museum.jpg, bayanaul-park.jpg
- Synchronized backend `server.js` with frontend attraction data

#### Frontend Path Fixes:
- Updated all image requires in data.js to use correct subdirectory paths (`../assets/astana/` and `../assets/pavlodar/`)

### PROMPT 3/10: Advanced Diagnostics Following Gemini Plan
**Problem Analysis:**
- Metro Bundler errors persisting despite correct file paths (likely cache issue)
- Railway 502 errors continue with SIGTERM logs
- Backend process failing to start properly

**Actions Taken:**

#### Frontend Cache Resolution:
- Verified that `HistoricalFactsScreen.js` and `RegionInfoScreen.js` have correct image paths
- Confirmed `placeholder.js` was properly deleted (no references found in codebase)
- Started Metro with `-c` flag to clear cache: `npx expo start -c`

#### Backend Enhanced Logging:
- Added comprehensive step-by-step logging to `backend/server.js` start sequence:
  - Environment checks (Node version, working directory, PORT)
  - Module loading verification (Express, CORS, dotenv)
  - Express app creation and middleware setup logging
  - Route definition confirmation
  - Server startup verification
- Each major step now logs success with ✅ checkmarks
- Added total attraction count verification (11 items)
- Added final "Backend fully initialized" confirmation

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Metro Bundler should now run without image resolution errors
- Railway deployment logs will show exactly where server.js fails
- Comprehensive diagnosis data for next troubleshooting phase

### PROMPT 4/10: Complete Resolution & Railway Deployment Fix
**Final Problem Identification:**
- Metro Bundler: Cache corruption causing phantom file errors
- Railway: Incorrect deployment configuration (looking for package.json in root instead of backend/)
- PowerShell: curl command incompatibility

**Systematic Solutions Applied:**

#### Frontend Metro Cache Fix:
- Removed `.expo` directory completely: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\.expo`
- Confirmed no actual references to `placeholder.js` in codebase via comprehensive grep search
- Restarted Metro with full cache clear: `npx expo start --clear`
- Verified Node.js processes running properly

#### Railway Deployment Architecture Fix:
- **Root Issue**: Railway was looking for `package.json` in project root, not in `backend/` subdirectory
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive Railway deployment configuration:
  - `railway.json` in root with `startCommand: "cd backend && npm start"`
  - `nixpacks.toml` with proper build phases pointing to backend directory  
  - `package-railway.json` as deployment helper
- Updated health check path to `/health` with 30s timeout
- Configured restart policy for failure recovery

#### PowerShell Compatibility:
- Fixed curl issues by using `Invoke-WebRequest` instead of `curl` command
- Confirmed Railway timeout (10s) indicating deployment issues
- Added proper error handling and timeout configuration

**Technical Implementation:**

Railway Configuration Stack:
```toml
# nixpacks.toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_18", "npm"]
[phases.install]
cmd = "cd backend && npm ci"
[start]
cmd = "cd backend && npm start"
```

```json
# railway.json  
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd backend && npm start",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health"
  }
}
```

**Results:**
- Metro Bundler: ✅ Cache cleared, no phantom file errors expected
- Railway: ✅ Proper deployment configuration pushed to GitHub
- Backend: 🔄 Awaiting Railway auto-deploy with correct configuration
- Frontend: ✅ Running with multiple Node.js processes active

## Current Status & Next Actions

### Frontend:
- ✅ Metro Bundle cache completely cleared
- ✅ No actual file path errors in codebase
- ✅ Expo running successfully with background processes
- 🔄 Testing bundle resolution after cache clear

### Backend: 
- ✅ Enhanced logging in server.js ready for diagnostics
- ✅ Correct Railway deployment configuration deployed
- 🔄 Awaiting Railway auto-deploy (typically 2-3 minutes)
- 🔄 Will test health endpoint after successful deploy

### Next Immediate Actions:
1. ⏳ Wait 1-2 minutes for Railway auto-deploy
2. 🧪 Test Railway health endpoint: `Invoke-WebRequest "https://tourgid-production-8074.up.railway.app/health"`
3. 📱 Test mobile app backend connectivity 
4. 🎯 Full end-to-end testing of Prompt Chaining pipeline

**Expected Resolution**: Both Metro bundling errors and Railway 502 errors should be resolved with these systematic fixes addressing root causes rather than symptoms.
